--Pushups

Keep your elbows in as you descend, then at the top, when you think youâ€™ve pushed all the way up, push just a little more and feel your shoulder blades roll around your ribcage.

--Sit Ups

Lie down on your back, keep your knees bent and your back and feet flat on the mat. Slowly lift your torso and sit up. Return to the starting position by rolling down one vertebrae at a time.

--Crunches


Lie down on the mat, keep your knees bent, your back and feet flat, and your hands supporting your head. Lift your shoulders, squeeze your abdominal muscles and hold it for one to two seconds. Slowly return to the starting position and repeat until set is complete.

--Leg Lifts

Lie supine on bench or mat. Place hands under lower buttock on each side to support pelvis. Keeping knees straight, raise legs by flexing hips until hips are completely flexed. Return until hips and knees are extended. Repeat.

--Squats

Stand with your head facing forward and your chest held up and out. Place your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider. Extend your hands straight out in front of you to help keep your balance. You can also bend the elbows or clasp the fingers. Sit back and down like you're sitting into an imaginary chair. Keep your head facing forward as your upper body bends forward a bit. Rather than allowing your back to round, let your lower back arch slightly as you descend. Lower down so your thighs are as parallel to the floor as possible, with your knees over your ankles. Press your weight back into your heels. Keep your body tight, and push through your heels to bring yourself back to the starting position.

--Plank

Slowly lift your entire torso off the floor or mat, maintaining a stiff torso and legs. Avoid any arching (sagging) in your low back, hiking (upwards) in your hips or bending in the knees. Avoid shrugging your shoulder and keep your shoulders positioned directly over your elbows with your palms facing down. Continue to breath while holding this position.

--Lunge

Keep your upper body straight, with your shoulders back and relaxed and chin up (pick a point to stare at in front of you so you don't keep looking down). Always engage your core.
Step forward with one leg, lowering your hips until both knees are bent at about a 90-degree angle. Make sure your front knee is directly above your ankle, not pushed out too far, and make sure your other knee doesn't touch the floor. Keep the weight in your heels as you push back up to the starting position.

--Pike Pushup
Start in a pushup position and raise your hips until you have a straight line going from your hands to your hips. Keep your elbows in as you descend, drive yourself back up and keep your hips up the entire time.

--Bear Crawl
Get on all fours with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips; keep your knees an inch above the ground. Crawl forward by taking a small step with your right arm and left leg at the same time and alternate. Keep your hips low and your head up.
